ARDcore Node
============

A ARD full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to [ARD with additional indexing](https://github.com/underdarkskies/ARD/tree/0.15.0-ARDcore) for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g ARDcore-node
ARDcore-node start
```

Note: For your convenience, we distribute ARDd binaries for x86_64 Linux and x86_64 Mac OS X. Upon npm install, the binaries for your platform will be downloaded. For more detailed installation instructions, or if you want to compile the project yourself, then please see the ARDcore branch of [ARD with additional indexing](https://github.com/underdarkskies/ARD/tree/0.15.0-ARDcore).

## Prerequisites

- GNU/Linux x86_32/x86_64, or OSX 64bit *(for ARDd distributed binaries)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12 or v4
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or zeromq on OSX)*
- ~200GB of disk storage
- ~8GB of RAM

## Configuration

ARDcore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your ARDcore Node.

```bash
ARDcore-node create -d <ARD-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
ARDcore-node install <service>
ARDcore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies. For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).

## Add-on Services
